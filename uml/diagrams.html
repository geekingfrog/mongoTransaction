    <h1>Transfer of money from A to B</h1>
    <p>There can be multiple application accessing the database at the same time.
      There can also be failure of an application or the database.</p>

    <p>An account has the following fieds: </p>

    <ul>
      <li>_id: mongodb's generated ID</li>
      <li>account_number</li>
      <li>balance: can be negative.</li>
      <li>pending_transactions: List of transactions' ids to be applied to this account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ideal case, no failure</h2>

    <div class="diagram">
      Title: Ideal case: transfer(A, B, 10)
      App->Transaction: Create transaction
      Note right of Transaction: Transaction created in state 'initial'
      App->Transaction: Set transaction to 'pending'
      App->A: decrease balance and add transaction to list of pending tr
      App->B: increase balance and add transaction to list of pending tr
      App->Transaction: Set transaction to 'committed'
      App->A: remove transaction from the list
      App->B: remove transaction from the list
      App->Transaction: Set transaction to 'done'
    </div>

    <h2>Failure case 1: cannot increase/decrease balance on an account or cannot set transaction to 'committed'</h2>
    <p>For whatever reason, one of the operation on an account fails.</p>

    <h3>Recoverable error</h3>
    <p>If possible, recover from the error (eg: database failure).</p>
    <p>
      In this case, the application can identify the transaction in 'pending' state, and try to apply
      again the changes, provided the transaction's id is not in the list of pending transactions for an account.
    </p>


    <div class="diagram">
      title: Recovery
      App->Transaction: Create transaction
      App->Transaction: Set transaction to 'pending'
      App->A: decrease balance and add transaction to list of pending tr
      App->B: Increase B's balance and add transaction to the list
      B-->App: Error when updating B's account or adding transaction
      Note over App: Recover from the error
      App->A: Do nothing since the transaction's id \nis in the list of pending transaction
      App->B: Decrease balance and add transaction \n to the list of pending transactions
      App->Transaction: Set transaction to 'committed'
      Note over Transaction: Resume with normal sequence
    </div>

    <h3>Failure case 2: cannot remove transaction from pending's list or set transaction to 'done'</h3>
    <p>In the same fashion as the previous example, this error is recoverable.</p>

    <div class="diagram">
      title: Recovery'
      App->Transaction: Set transaction to 'committed'
      App->A: Remove transaction from the list
      App->B: Remove transaction from the list
      B-->App: Error
      Note over App: Recover
      App-->A: Do nothing, transaction already removed
      App->B: Remove transaction
      App->Transaction: Set transaction to 'done'
    </div>
